          The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which
          has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their

          into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the
          Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where
          it was forged.The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One
